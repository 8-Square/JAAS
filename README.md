# JAAS
Just An Annoying Script

This script mainly changes the resolution, flips the screen and magnifies the screen (and also a rickroll at the end)

**THIS IS A PRANK/HARMLESS SCRIPT THAT DOESNT HAVE ANY ACTUAL EFFECT ON YOUR COMPUTER (All changes are easily reversible)**

## Instructions
To run: just run jaas.py


**To reverse its effects:**
- close notepad
- close magnifier
- go to system -> display -> scale and layout
  - change scale back to recommended
  - change display resolution back to recommended
  - change display orientation to landscape (default)
